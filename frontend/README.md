### USERS
##### Added Two Users:
a) root-> 1234
b) rishi-> 5678  

#### When you run this code after cloning both the frontend and backend repository 
#### first create the database task in your local sql server and then add two users in the 
#### login table, rishi and root with the above password. SO, that when you login validation occurs
#### successfully or else you won't be able to get inside the login page because initially in your local
#### system when task database is not there and JPA does not create it, so create it manually and inside that create table login with the following 2 users.
